Here’s a cleaned-up and professional **README.md** for your Pomodoro Timer project, formatted properly with Markdown, code blocks, and clear sections:

# ⏱ Pomodoro Timer

A simple **Pomodoro Timer** application with two versions:

* **macOS** (Menu bar app using `rumps`)
* **Windows** (GUI app using `tkinter`)

Both are written in **Python** and can be packaged into standalone executables.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 (Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

---

## macOS Instructions

### 1. Install Required Library

```bash
pip install rumps
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python Timer.py
```

This will launch the Pomodoro timer in your **macOS menu bar**.

### 3. Build as a Standalone App

First, install **PyInstaller** if you don’t have it:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then package the app:

```bash
pyinstaller -w --icon=timer.png Timer.py
```

The `.app` file will be located inside the **dist/** folder.

---

## Windows Instructions

### 1. Install Required Library

No extra libraries needed — the **Windows version uses tkinter**, which comes with Python.

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python pomodoro_timer.py
```

This will open the Pomodoro Timer in a **separate application window**.

### 3. Build as a Standalone Executable

First, install **PyInstaller** if you don’t have it:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then package the app:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile pomodoro_timer.py
```

The `.exe` file will be located inside the **dist/** folder.
